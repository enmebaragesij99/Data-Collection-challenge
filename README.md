# Data-Collection-challenge

This is my Module 11- Data Collection challenge, which consists of two python notebook files: Part 1 -which includes web scraping title and preview text from Mars news articles,
and Part 2-which includes web scraping and analysis of Mars weather data.

## Contents

- part_2_mars_weather_final(jupyter notbook file)

- mars_df(csv-exported from part_2 DataFrame)

## About

-Part 1: The titles and preview texts from Mars news site were extracted via web scraping and all stored as dictionaries in a Python list

-Part 2: Data was scraped from the data in the HTML table on Mars Temperature Data site and converted into a Pandas Dataframe. The data types of each column were examined and
converted to the appropriate data types and, finally the data was analysed using Panda functions and the Dataframe was exported to a CSV file.
